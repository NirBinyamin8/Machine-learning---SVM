This project is divided into 4 phases:
1 - I built an svm model on the classification_simple dataset with the help of the quadratic program for svm and with the help of the dual program.
2- I used the SVM dual program with the use of a kernel and ran on the dataset. Use different kernels
with different parameters. For example, a polynomial kernel with different degrees and/or an RBF kernel with different values for the gamma coefficient.
3- Independent implementation of the SVM class.
4- Running the department I built on the dataset processed wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer.
