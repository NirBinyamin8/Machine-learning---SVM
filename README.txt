This multifaceted project focuses on the development and application of Support Vector Machines (SVM). Initially, an SVM model was constructed for the 'classification_simple' dataset using both quadratic and dual programs. The project's second phase delved deeper into SVM's dual program, experimenting with various kernels like polynomial and RBF, each tweaked with different parameters. The third phase saw an independent creation of the SVM class. Finally, the developed model was applied to the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset, showcasing its real-world applicability.
