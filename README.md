# Support Vector Machines (SVM) Project

## Overview
This project delves deep into the development and application of Support Vector Machines (SVM). It ranges from constructing basic SVM models to experimenting with advanced kernels, and ultimately demonstrates real-world applicability with a known dataset.

## Phase 1: SVM Model Construction
- Developed an SVM model for the `classification_simple` dataset.
- Employed both quadratic and dual programs for model creation.

## Phase 2: Advanced Kernel Experimentation
- Explored the SVM's dual program in-depth.
- Experimented with various kernels:
  - Polynomial
  - Radial Basis Function (RBF)
- Each kernel was tuned with distinct parameters to achieve optimal performance.

## Phase 3: SVM Class Creation
- Independently constructed an SVM class.
- The class encapsulates the functionalities and operations related to SVM, offering a seamless experience for SVM modeling.

## Application: Real-world Dataset
- Applied the developed SVM model to the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset.
- The application showcases the model's capability to handle and analyze real-world datasets effectively.
